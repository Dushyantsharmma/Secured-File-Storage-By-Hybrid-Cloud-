### Getting Started with FileStorageFire

Welcome to **FileStorageFire**! This project utilizes **Create React App** to provide a seamless experience for building a cloud-based file storage service. Follow the steps below to set up and run the application locally:

#### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your machine:

- **Node.js** (v12 or later)
- **npm** (Node package manager, which comes with Node.js)

#### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   Begin by cloning the repository to your local machine. Open your terminal and run:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Dushyantsharmma/Secured-File-Storage-By-Hybrid-Cloud-.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**:
   Change your working directory to the cloned repository:
   ```bash
   cd FileStorageFire
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**:
   Install the required dependencies using npm:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

#### Running the Application

- **Start the Development Server**:
  Launch the app in development mode with:
  ```bash
  npm start
  ```
  This will open your default web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`, where you can view the application in action.

- **Hot Reloading**:
  The app supports hot reloading, meaning any changes you make to the code will automatically refresh in the browser. This makes it easy to iterate on your design and functionality.

#### Building for Production

When you're ready to deploy your application, create a production build by running:
```bash
npm run build
```
This command will bundle your application and optimize it for performance, generating static files in the `build` directory.

#### Testing Your Application

To run tests, use the following command:
```bash
npm test
```
This will launch the test runner in interactive mode, allowing you to monitor test results and ensure your application functions correctly.

#### Customization and Ejecting

If you wish to customize your project further, you can eject it at any time using:
```bash
npm run eject
```
**Note**: This action is irreversible. Ejecting will expose the configuration files, giving you full control over the setup.
